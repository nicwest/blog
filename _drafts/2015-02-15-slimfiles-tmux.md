I have been ssh-ing into servers/vm's recently and been editing things. Installing
[my dotfiles][dotfiles] was a pain. 

This is my attempt at making a set of viable slim config files, aimed
specifically at what I might require when ssh-ing into a remote server.

This article will be about tmux. previous article was about [vim][vim-post]

[The full files are on github][slimfiles]

# Tmux

[Tmux][tmux] is a terminal multiplexer. Allows you to divide up your terminal
console into windows and panels.
