I am a web developer living in London and working at [Ingresso][ingresso]. 
I spend most of my time working on a large obj-c monolith, building
microservices in go, and refactoring and testing django applications. I think
of my self as a most-of-stack developer, and I'm happy-ish building frontend,
backend, databases, and server infrastructure. I am beginning to enjoy writing
documentation. I will look for an excuse to regexp the shit out of a problem
(I blame my perl upbringing).

From 2010 through 2014 I ran [Stunjelly][stunjelly] with [Edward Knowles][ned].
Stunjelly was a eBook and digital publishing consultancy that specialised
in fixing broken books and producing exciting interactive texts. We won the 
[Best Ebook in the Children's category][award] at the Digital Book World 
Conference with '[A Dinosaur that Pooped Christmas][dinopoop]'.

I'm a heavy Vim user and enjoy writing Vim script. Here's my [My vimrc][vimrc].
I wrote at least [one plugin that is actually terrible][QQ].

I spend a disproportionate amount of time fantasising about how much better my
life would be if I was a clojure developer.

Technically I'm a furniture designer. I made an decent table once; and it was
pretty much downhill from there.  I now own a [prusa 3d MkII] and it is quite
simply the best thing ever! I'm enjoying mixing programming with product
design and am creating some truly awful things.

Something something... mechanical keyboards!

Occasionally I'm not using a computer. Sadly I'm fairly stereotypical. I like
reading (literally only fantasy and historical fiction), magic the gathering,
vaping, cooking, tanks, pretending to play squash, and watching rugby.
