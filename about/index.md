I am a web developer living in London and working at [ingresso][ingresso]. 
I spend most of my time working on a large objc monolith, building microservices
in go, and refactoring and testing django applications. I think of my self as a
most-of-stack developer, and I'm happy-ish building frontend, backend,
databases, and server infrastructure. I fucking love regexp.

From 2010 through 2014 I ran [Stunjelly][stunjelly] with [Edward Knowles][ned].
Stunjelly was a eBook and digital publishing consultancy that specialised
in fixing broken books and producing exciting interactive texts. We won the 
[Best Ebook in the Children's category][award] at the Digital Book World 
Conference with '[A Dinosaur that Pooped Christmas][dinopoop]'.
 
I'm a heavy Vim user and enjoy writing Vim script. here's my [My vimrc][vimrc].
I wrote at least [one plugin that is actually terrible][QQ].

I spend a disproportionate amount of time fantasising about how much better my
life would be if I was a clojure developer.

Currently I'm learning elixir and despite weeks of trying I'm yet to write
anything useful in it.

Technically I'm a furniture designer. I made an decent table once; and it was
pretty much downhill from there.

Open hardware and products are the future. With 3D printing and rapid
prototyping getting cheaper all the time, things are getting pretty exciting.

I'm currently using the first of my two Ergodox keyboards, and would sadly
describe my self as keyboard enthusiast.

Occasionally I'm not using a computer. Sadly I'm fairly stereotypical. I like
reading (literally only fantasy and historical fiction), magic the gathering,
vaping, cooking, tanks, pretending to play squash, and watching rugby.
