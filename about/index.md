I am a junior web developer living in London. I spend most of my time creating
[django][django] web applications in [python][python]. I think of my self as a
most-of-stack developer, and I'm happy-ish building frontend, backend,
databases, and server infrastructure. I fucking love regexp

From 2010 through 2014 I ran [Stunjelly][stunjelly] with [Edward Knowles][ned].
Stunjelly was a eBook and digital publishing consultancy that specialised
in fixing broken books and producing exciting interactive texts. We won the 
[Best Ebook in the Children's category][award] at the Digital Book World 
Conference with '[A Dinosaur that Pooped Christmas][dinopoop]'.
 
I'm a heavy Vim user and enjoy writing Vim script. [My vimrc][vimrc] is messy
but awesome, and I wrote at least [one plugin that isn't terrible][QQ].

Currently I'm learning [clojure][clojure] and [clojurescript][clojurescript].
The combination is awesome especially when you throw things like [react][react]
into the mix.

Technically I'm a furniture designer. I made an decent table once; and it was
pretty much downhill from there.

Open hardware and products are the future. With 3D printing and rapid
prototyping getting cheaper all the time, things are getting pretty exciting.
I'm currently using the second of my two Ergodox keyboards (Matias Clicky
switches)

Occasionally I'm not using a computer. Sadly I'm fairly stereotypical. I like
reading (literally only fantasy and historical fiction), magic the gathering,
vaping, cooking, tanks, and squash.
